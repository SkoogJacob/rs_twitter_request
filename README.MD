# Twitter Request

This package aims to simplify making requests to Twitter in rust by enforcing very basic
sanity checks through the type system.

!! Abandoned !!

Due to what's going on with twitter, I'm just not interested in working with the Twitter
API as a side project. The program currently allows for making rudimentary requests
to the twitter search and to query for tweets with tweet IDs, and I suppose that's how
it will remain.
